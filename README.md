# About

The purpose of this app is to display Pokedex entries from the Pokemon video game series using the Pokeapi (https://pokeapi.co/).
This is a non-profit project and being created only for the purposes of learning how to code.
Currently this app is planned to support English only.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functions
Currently planned functions are:

* Pulling all Pokedex entries or a single entry of a single Pokemon via name or number.
* Pulling a random Pokedex entry from any game that can be limited and filtered via numbers or game.
* Creation of a Pokemon guessing game based on the Pokedex entry.
